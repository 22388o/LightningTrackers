# LightningTrackers
## Services that keep track of the network. They can be indexes, trackers or search engines.

**Lightning Network (LNP) is a structure of payment channels open between private individuals and/or companies and represents the scaling solution for Bitcoin; that's why we often called it also the Bitcoin' Second Layer.**

With Lightning we can potentially make hundreds of thousands if not million transactions per second and so reach any part of the World (almost) instantaneously.

Lightning therefore constitutes a true P2P network, in full compliance with the abstract of the Bitcoin whitepaper created by Satoshi Nakamoto, while the Base (Settlement) Layer, with its blockchain, is more similar to a broadcast system, since the transaction transcription and so their irreversibility depends on the miners.


Trackers are useful not only to keep track of the state of the network, but also to have statistics, URIs, info about the fees enstablished by the node operators and other useful data.

My proposal is to collect these trackers to have a sort of meta-index so we can compare all the data provided by them. 
So, let's do it!
